# Soft Muted

Theme for Atom, Emacs, Micro, Textmate, and Vscode. Much of it converted from the textmate file (built using the [tmtheme-editor](https://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/#!/editor/theme/Monokai)), all of it based on (in varying degrees) the [github iterm2 theme](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes#github). Colors may vary between editors due to degree of difficulty (emacs) or process (awkward conversion). See also [swatches](./color-swatch) for html files containing related css cmyk/rgba/hex color codes.
